# VulkanExample
My personal introduction into the Vulkan SDK on Mac OS X using the Molten Vk Translation Layer and c++17, following the tutorial (kind of) on https://vulkan-tutorial.com.

This was written in XCode with imported libraries vulkansdk 1.2.162, glfw 3.3 and glm 0.9, therefore no make file.

This Project is not intended for any kind of reusability
